What is SQL? (Structured Query Language)
    Designed for creating reading updating and deleting data from databases
    SQL is used as a baseline for relational databases

Data are collection of data separated in different tables

Rows -> one user, one record
column -> userid, username

ralational database -> a collection of different tables that represent different objects inside of your data

Why is it important to learn SQL?
    Becasue data is everywhere, and SQL is the easiest way to store data and knowing SQL in complex level will significantly help in your development career

Create and manage different databases

relational database management system

What is a database(DB)?

- Any collection of related information
 * Phone Book
 * Shopping list
 * Todo list
 * Your 5 best friends
 * Facebook's User Base

- Databases can be stored in different ways
 * On Paper
 * In your mind
 * On a computer

Computers + Databases = <3

Amazon.com
- Keeps track of products, reviews, purchase orders, credit cards, users, media, etc
- Trillions of pieces of information need to be stored and readily available
- information is extremely valuable and critical to amazon.com's functioning
- security is essential, amazon stores peoples personal information
- information is stored on a computer

Shopping list
- Keeps track of consumer products that need to be purchased
- 10 - 20 pieces of information need to be stored and readily available
- information is for convenience sake only and not necessary for Shopping
- security is not important
- information is stored on a piece of paper, or even just in someone's memory

Computers are great at keeping track of large amounts of information

Database Management Systems (DBMS)

A special software program that helps users create and maintain a database
    - Makes it easy to manage large amounts of information
    - Handles security
    - Backups
    - Importing/exporting data
    - Concurrency
    - Interacts with software applications
     * Programming languages


Amazon.com Database Diagram

Amazon.com will interact with the DBMS in order to create, read, update and delete information(CRUD)

Two types of Databases

Relational Database(SQL)
* Organize data into one or more tables
 - Each table has columns and rows
 - A unique key identifies each row

Non-Relational (noSQL/not just SQL)
* Organize data is anything but a traditional table
 - Key-value stores
 - Documents (JSON, XML, etc)
 - Graphs
 - Flexible Tables

Relational Databases(SQL)

- Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)
    - Help users create and maintain a relational database
        - mySQL, Oracle, postgresSQL, mariaDB, etc

- Structured Query Language (SQL)
    - Standard Query Language for interacting with RDBMS
    - Used to perform C.R.U.D operations, as well as other administrative tasks (under management, security, backup, etc)
    - Used to define tables and structures
    - SQL code used on one RDBMS is not always portable to another without modification

Database Queries

Queries are requests made to the database management system for specific information

As the database's structure become more and more complex, it becomes more difficult to get the specific pieces of information we want

A google search is a query

Structured Query Language(SQL)

SQL is a language used for interacting with Relational Database Management Systems(RDBMS)
    - You can use SQL to get the RDBMS to do things for you
        - Create, retrieve, update & delete data
        - Create & manage Databases
        - Design & create database tables
        - Perform administration tasks (security, user management, import/export, etc)

SQL implementations vary between systems
    - Not all RDBMS' follow the SQL standard to a 'T'
    - The concepts are the same but the implementation may vary

SQL is actually a hybrid language, it's basically 4 types of languages in one
    - Data Query Language (DQL)
        - Used to query the database for information
        - get information that is already stored there
    - Data Definition Language (DDL)
        - Used for defining database schemas
    - Data Control Language (DCL)
        - Used for controlling access to the data in the databse
        - User & permissions management
    - Data Manipulation Language (DML)
        - Used for inserting, updating and deleting data from the database

Queries

- A query is  set of instructions given to the RDBMS (written is SQL) that tell the RDBMS what information you want it to retrieve for you
    - TONS of data in a DB
    - Often hidden in a complex schema
    - Goal is to only get the data you need

'grab exactly the information you want!'
